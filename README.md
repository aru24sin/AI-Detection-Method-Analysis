# AI-Detection-Method-Analysis
Summer undergraduate research project for the SURE 2024 program at University of Michigan-Dearborn under Dr. Ang Li. Utilized GenImage ensemble framework of detection methods to analyze detection performance.

Research poster shown at SURE 2024 Showcase uploaded to repository.

Benchmark datasets used: ADM, BigGAN, glide, midjourney, stable_diffusion_v_1_4, and vqdm

Used GenImage framework of detector codes including CNNDetection-master, pytorch-image-models-0.6.12(ResNet50), and started Swin-Transformer-main to analyze the performance of such models. Analysis of models is conducted through metrics such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and accuracy. Analysis was conducted after the model was trained on a benchmark dataset.
